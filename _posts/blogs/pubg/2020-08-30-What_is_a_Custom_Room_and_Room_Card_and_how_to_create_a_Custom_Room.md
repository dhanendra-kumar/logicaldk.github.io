A description of Custom Room and Room Cards in PUBG Mobile

In this blog post you will learn the process to create a PUBG Mobile custom room.

**What is a PUBG Custom Room?**

In PUBG Mobile, rooms are used to host custom matches where the player who creates the room can set the map, weapons (Sniper, Assault Rifles and many more), and mode (Solo, Duo or Squad).

Well, itâ€™s essentially a player-hosted lobby where you can set custom rules for matches and have people around you join and play against each other. Anyone with the Room ID and password can join the room.

**What is a Room Card and how to obtain it?**

PUBG Mobile Custom Rooms are created by obtaining a Room Card by any of the below mentioned ways. Let's have a look at the various ways to obtain a Room Card:

**#1 From the Clan Shop:**

1. Tap the Clan tab which is present on the bottom-left side of the Lobby Screen.
2. Tap the Shop tab which is present on the right side of the Clan lobby Screen .
3. Tap the Room Card: 1-Use.
4. Purchase the Custom Room Card for 300 Clan Points.

**NOTE:** This Room Card is a 1-time use only and would disappear after being used.

**#2 From the Elite Royale Pass:**

1. At level 14, you get a Room Card: 1-Day.
2. At level 37, you get a Room Card: 3-Day.
3. At level 85, you get a Room Card: 7-Day.

**NOTE:** You can create an unlimited number of rooms until the length (duration) of the Room Card expires.

Hope this helps...
